\section{Exercise 1: K-CV, under \& over-fitting}

\subsection{Part a}
\begin{itemize}[label=$\square$]
    \item Under-fitting: The model does not stick enough to the data.

    $\rightarrow$ not complex enough: this family of models can't represent the underlying model
    \\
    $\rightarrow$ did not learn enough
    \\
    $\rightarrow$ we can say it's under-fitting when both error on data and error on test sample are high

    \item Over-fitting: The model sticks too much to the data, it won't generalize well on never met data

    $\rightarrow$ too complex for the underlying model. We try to interpret small changes as if they were representing something but is in reality only noise
    \\
    $\rightarrow$ learned too much from the data
    \\
    $\rightarrow$ we can say it's over-fitting when data error is low but test sample error is hight
    \\
    $\rightarrow$ another symptom of over-fitting is also skyscraping high values for parameters of the model
